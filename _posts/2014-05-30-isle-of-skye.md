Normally people refer to the Isle of Skye as „the Skye“. It reminds me a lot of the <a href="http://aud.li/2011/06/30/lofoten/">Lofoten</a> in Norway. Mountains, green hills, oceans, small houses, cliffs, beaches and of course sheep. We went to Portree the largest town on the island, where we are staying for three nights. It’s a lovely fishing village, with a lot of tourists and too few restaurants. Luckily there is a great place for fish and chips just at the harbour.

Today we went on the hike to Ben Edra, a mountain of the Trotternish Ridge. It was sunny at first, but then we got lost in a swamp. By the time we were almost at the top, the fog came from the ocean and we decided to go back again to avoid getting lost in the fog.
