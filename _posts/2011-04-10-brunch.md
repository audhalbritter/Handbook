Brunch is a meal that you eat in the late morning as a combination of breakfast and lunch (Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary). My favourite meal is a late breakfast. There are probably many good places to have a brunch. But here are some I have found:

- Hotel Restaurant <a href="http://www.baseltor.ch/">Baseltor</a> in Solothurn. Here you get a traditional Swiss brunch in the nice hotel in the old town of Solothurn.

- <a href="http://www.glenwoodrestaurants.com/">Glenwood</a> Restaurant Campus in Eugene (OR). If you ever go to Eugene in the United States this is the place for a real American brunch. Reservation at the weekends recomended.

- <a href="http://gudvangen.com/">Gudvangen Fjordtell</a>. In this remote but beautiful place we had brunch after camping. The place is a wooden house with a lot of glas and you get a good view of the fjord. Very traditional Norwegian brunch.
