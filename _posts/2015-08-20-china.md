I have only been a few days in China, but I already love it. The people are very friendly and try to help, even if they understand aÂ word. The food is excellent although I temporarily had to give up being vegetarian, because they don't understand what it is. Vegetarian = vegetables! We went up to 4100m today and looked at plants. It's amazing and unlike Australia we can recognize many species, not the species but genus. We saw yaks, snow, mountains, red stones (algae) and had Tibetan butter tea.
