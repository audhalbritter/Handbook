 	<li>I organized two trait courses, one in the Andes in Peru, and another one close to the North Pole on Svalbard. It was fun to see two very different places and meet and work with so many people.</li>
 	<li>I did lots of wonderful ski trips with my new touring skis.</li>
</ul>

 	<li>I got an NFR grant to start my own research project and have a job for another 4 years.</li>
 	<li>I published 5 papers.</li>
</ul>
Thanks to everybody who shared 2018 with me!

I don't make new years resolutions, that's stupid, but for 2019, I want to (re)discover the purpose of life, focus on what I want to give and not what I want to take and understand that nobody owes me anything (some of this is borrowed by Dr. Jacquelyn Gill). Stay wild, read lot's of papers and books, do amazing field work in Norway, China and maybe Switzerland, learn to bake bread in the fire. If I am lucky I might move back to Switzerland but maybe I'll just stay a little bit longer in Bergen. And I want to "create" more things again: make bags, purses with cool fabric and leather, maybe learn to dye fabric and make a pair of ski's (I don't have enough yet).
