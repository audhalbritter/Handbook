I have digged out an old analog camera (Zeiss Contaflex super), which I have never really used. Surprisingly, everything (even the light sensor) still works. I brought the camera to tenerife. The funny thing with this camera is, that all the pictures look like they were taken 50 year ago, which is a nice side effect. The best thing about analog photographing is still, waiting for the pictures to be developed. It takes agesÂ and when they come, you have totally forgotten, what pictures you have taken. And so every picture is a surprise!
