Today was my first day in Bergen. I was shown the university and went for a stroll in the area. I found a lake, ideal for swimming in summer and a stave church.

The weather is very nice at the moment, but I am still used to 25°C. I need to adapt to colder summer temperatures.

My bike found the way to the house as well today and only one screw was missing. Tomorrow, I am going to the mountains to have a look at my new field sites.
