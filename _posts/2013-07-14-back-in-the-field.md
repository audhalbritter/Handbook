I had my PhD defense last Tuesday and went right back to the field on Wednesday and Thursday. Not really for work, more for fun. Yes, I had to clean up my field sites, but it was not hard work and I had time to take some pictures.

This weekend I was in Bern and next week I will try to get some new stamps into the shop. And of course relax, go swimming and enjoy the sun as long as the weather is fine.

And yes I past!!!
