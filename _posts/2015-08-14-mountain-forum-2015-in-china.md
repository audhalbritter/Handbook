I am off to China in a couple of hours. I will fly to Chengdu where I will participate the <a href="http://nof2015.uib.no/course/index.html">Mountain Forum 2015</a>. We will spend some days in Chengdu with lectures on various topics in mountain ecology and learning about traits data. Then we will head off to the mountains to do actual field work and get a traits data set along an elevational gradient. We will stay in Moxi a town located at 2500m, near Mt. Gongga. The field sites go up to 4000m.
