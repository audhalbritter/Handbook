My career has changed dramatically in the last weeks. Instead of doing science I've become a movie star. Last week, I recorded statistic videos in a studio in Kristiansand and on the weekend I produced a video that goes along with an application from the <a href="http://www.rgs.org/HomePage.htm">Royal Geographic Society</a> to get a Landrover for the next field season.

Here is the video for the application!
