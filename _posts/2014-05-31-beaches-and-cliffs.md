Today, the sun woke us up and we went for a stroll on a beach with cows J. The car told us, it was 25Â°C. It felt like Greece, just greener. Later we found a nice coffee and cake place in Dunvegan and ate a carrot cake. Here, they use orange flavour in the carrot cake, which is delicious.

In the afternoon I wanted to see some cliffs and we drove to the western end of the island and found some pretty steep and rough cliffs.
