I am back in Oregon for the ESA Conference in Portland. This is the third time I am visiting Oregon, but there is still a lot to discover. The nature is very diverse with coast, mountains, plains, and deserts. And I just love it.

<span style="font-size: 20px;">Before the conference starts, Mr. K and me are travelling for a couple of days in Oregon and maybe Washington. We have started our trip at Mt. Hood. It's very warm and dry but people were still skiing on Mt. Hood. We found the lovely Alpine Ski Haus to stay the night. And I even found some Norwegian bindings...</span>
