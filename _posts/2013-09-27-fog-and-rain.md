After bad luck both at Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Rainier, (that was the view):

we spent a wonderful sunny evening at one of the most beautiful campsites so far. Very small, nice people, and a wonderful lake. They don't have WIFI, and therefore not too many guest go there. Internet seems to be a standard when you go camping nowadays. Also the big flatscreen is a must.

We are slowly moving north again and will have to give back Sophia next Monday and then spend some days in Seattle, before going to Portland and the lovely Oregon!
