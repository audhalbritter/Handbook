You probably know X-men and have heard of mutants in the animal world. But mutations can also occur in the plant world and it's not that rare. But what my students Linn and Signe found in the field a couple of days ago is remarkable.

They are studying phenology and pollinators on common buttercup (<em>Ranunculus acris</em>) and have to look at the plants very carefully. A normal buttercup looks like the plant on the left side.And they found this beautiful plant on the right side! You might think that this is not the same plant, but they have the same leaves, which are very distinct.

This mutant is probably not fertile, because the stigma and stamen are not developed. But it has more petals than a normal buttercup flower and looks like a rose.
