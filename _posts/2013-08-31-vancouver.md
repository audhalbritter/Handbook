We have safely arrived in Vancouver and are staying in a lovely guesthouse in the middle of the city. It has been raining half of the time, but what do you expect when you go to a rainforest? Just now the weather is changing and the sun is coming out. We will stay in Vancouver for a few more days and then we are on the road for a month.
