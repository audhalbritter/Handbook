We spent one night in a tiny town called John Day. The two museums in town were closed so we had to go out of town to see things. The landscape around the town is amazing and the gorgeous Strawberry Mountains are located close by. Despite the cold (below 0 at night) we went for a hike into these mountains. It was freezing at first but we got warm when walking uphill. And then we came to this lovely lake called Strawberry lake. The water was frozen at the edge but it was warm in the sun.
