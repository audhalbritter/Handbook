Yesterday we took the train south to Mosj√∏en our "adopted home". The train had left 7 minutes late, the landscape passed by and we were enjoying the ride. Due to technical problems the train had to drive very slowely up the mountain and delayed even more. The thing is that there are only a few trains on this route each day and if you don't catch your connections you won't get home.

Suddenly the train stopped in the middle of nowhere. A girl and the conductor went to the door, the girl jumped out and climed up the hill to the road. Few seconds later a bus arrived. He picked up the girl. The train had contacted the bus and they had arranged where to meet so the girl could get on the bus which brought her home. Pretty nice I thought. And would anyone had done that in Switzerland...
