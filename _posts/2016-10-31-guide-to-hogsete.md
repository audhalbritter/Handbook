Høgsete is a field site close to Flåm in western Norway where I do field work. It is a 30 min walk up a steep hill and through forest. It's tricky to reach, because there are a lot sheep trails and more than one person have gone lost trying to find it (including me).

Amy took pictures, while Francesca, Nicola and me showed the way. I hope nobody will ever get lost again. The guide can be downloaded here: <a href="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/RoadToHogsete-1.pdf">GuideToHogsete</a>
