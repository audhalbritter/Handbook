I finally reached my northern most site. For all who don't know I will do a transplant experiment this summer where I will plant species from Switzerland and Norway to 5 different places. And two of them are in Norway and I am visiting them at the moment. But plantig is far away here. It's still deep winter. About 1m snow, it's still snowing and temperature is around 0°C. But the days are getting longer: 5:30 - 20:00, top that!
