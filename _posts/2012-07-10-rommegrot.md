Recipe for 6 persons:

1 l rømme (Sour cream or something similar. Must have about 35% fat. The sour cream you can buy in the shops is not ok. Maybe you can get it in a dairy or on a farm)
6 dl flour
1 l milk
2 tablespoon sugar
1.5 tea spoon salt

Kok the sour cream 15 min or until you can see small drops of fat. Remove the pan from the fire. Spread the flour (2 dl) on top and kok it again. Now the fat from the rømme should come out. Remove the fat and put it in a little pan. Put on the rest of the flour, 4 dl. Warm the milk. Dilute the sour cream with milk and keep stirring. Add sugar, salt and the fat.

Serve the dish with sugar and cinnamon.
