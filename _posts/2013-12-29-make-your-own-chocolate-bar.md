Have you ever wanted to make your own Chocolate bar? It's very easy. You need dark chocolate, butter or coconut oil and whatever you want to have in the chocolate. I used almonds, cranberries and apricots.

Melt the chocolate, add the oil or butter and maybe some cream. Cut the nuts and berries and fruits. Pour the melted chocolate into a flat form and put the nuts, berries and fruits on top of the chocolate. Finished.

The idea from the <a href="http://www.serendipity-blog.de/lasst-uns-froh-und-lecker-sein-pamk-4-2/">serendipity blog</a>. There is also a nice way how to wrap the chocolate for a gift.
