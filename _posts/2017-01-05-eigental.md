Is there still untouched nature? Close to where you live?

The closest place I can think of is the Eigental. A couple of years ago the municipalities and conservationists argued about a road going trough a nature reserve. The road needed mending and the conservationists demanded tunnels below the road for the amphibians. But nobody wanted to pay and nothing happened. Ever since the road has been closed and no one is allowed to drive there.

Today, I wanted to check out this "untouched" nature and walked through the snow. I met pretty sights, but not as untouched as I hoped.
