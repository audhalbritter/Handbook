"<em>Love isn’t a state of perfect caring. It is an active noun like “struggle.” To love someone is to strive to accept that person exactly the way he or she is, right here and now." </em>Fred Rogers

Watch the documentary about Fred Rogers and his television show for kids: Mister Rogers' Neighborhood.
