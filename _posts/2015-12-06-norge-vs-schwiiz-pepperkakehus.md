Pepperkakehus is a Norwegian tradition unknown in Switzerland. In the advent time, Norwegians creat their "pepperkakehuset" - the gingerbread house. The house is carefully designed on paper before it's transferd to the dough. The different pieces of the house are then baked and glued together with caramel. Finally, the house is decorated with a white mass consisting of pouder sugar, lemon juice and egg white and usually "Non-stop" as tiles on the roof.

If you are ambigous, you also make a sledge with reindeer, fir trees, stars and hearts. We felt extremely creative last night and went one step further. Because we are biologists and wanted to set an example for ongoing climate change we added a palm tree, a polar bear, a polar fox, a whale and pinguin.
