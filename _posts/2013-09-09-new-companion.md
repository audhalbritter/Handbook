We found a new companion. He is very small and not totally finished yet. He would like to have a proper pair of eyes but so far I have not found any that fit him. And he also needs a name.

I found the knitting pattern again on <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/fluffandfuzz?ref=l2-shopheader-name">fluff and fuzz</a> and the inspiration to take him along on our journey <a href="http://fluffandfuzzknitting.wordpress.com/2013/09/02/pocket-monkey-adventures/">here</a>. We are waiting for better days for the monkey.
