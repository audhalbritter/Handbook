One reason we drove all the way to Å was that I wanted to find a plant called <em>Plantago lanceolata</em>. Last year during the field survey in Scandinavia I found <em>Plantago</em> in Oslo but not further north. It should occur as far north as Bodø. The distribution maps show one spot on the Lofoten. So this was the excuse to go there. Yesterday we had wondered around but had not found a single plant. Today we started a new attempt to find the plant. I had checked the maps for days to find the right spot.

One of the great things about Mr. K is that he always finds the best parking spot. If we go to a concert in the <em>City</em> he will always find a spot just outside the club. So today when I tried to guide him to the right spot to find the <em>Plantago</em> he suddenly stoped the car on a sandy strip next to the road. I jumped out of the car and landed right on a <em>Plantago</em>. What a surprise. How does he do it?!?
