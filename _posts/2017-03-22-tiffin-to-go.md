Many people have no access to good and healthy lunch opportunities in Bergen. And søtt+salt is trying a new concept this and next week: high quality lunch in tiffin boxes to go. No plastic, no garbage. The lunch can be ordered (vegetarian option) and can be picked up or be delivered.

I tried it this week and it was excellent. I'm hoping this will become a regular lunch option in Bergen.
