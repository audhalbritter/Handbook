InÂ a bit less than 2 weeks I will go to Bergen in Norway for 1.5 years. Sometimes, I still don't believe it myself. My SNF proposal was granted and now I can study how alpine plants and pollinators respond to climate change.

I am both scared and very excited for what will come. New city, new job, new people, being far away from Mr. K, family and friends. But I am also looking forward to long summer nights, field work in the mountains, snow in winter and the ocean.

My new address is Paradisehill, which sounds promising.
