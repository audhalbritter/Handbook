Holidays in Håvoll are working holidays and there is always a lot to do: gardening, cutting wood, painting the house, the boat, the barn. And every year we come up with all the things we also want to do: build a patio, get a jacuzzi, rebuilt the bathroom(!), get a new boat, buy a canoe, create a new forrest and built a watermill to produce power.

We didn't do all of that. But we painted the house. Actually, Marcus did most of the work! Thanks, it looks fantastic!
