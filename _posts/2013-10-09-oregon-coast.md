From Portland we have traveled down the Coast to Eugene. I just love this misty coast and we were really lucky with the weather. Two days full of sunshine! I have already been to part of the coast but these lovely endless dunes were new to me. And we had them to our own.

We have arrived in Eugene, where I spent four month working on my master thesis. This was 5 years ago. At lot is still the same. But we discovered some new cool places. Unfortunately the weather was a bit wet today, but it's supposed to be nice tomorrow.
