Today was our last day on the Lofoten. As you might have picked we really liked it here. The weather is great and we are not doing very much which is good for a while. I could imagine to stay here for a bit longer. But always if you get used to something you should change it. So that's why we'll take the boat to the main land tomorrow and go on.
