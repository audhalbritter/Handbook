If in Chengdu, eating hot pot is a must. You can get it elsewhere in China, but Chengdu is known for very good hot pot. The name explains what it is: a pot full of spices. The chilis swim on top and the Sichuan pepper makes your toungue go numb so that you can eat more spices.

Chinese people put in all kinds of things in the hot pot. Mainly meat. Ham, pork, chicken, chicken head and pig brain (this is essential). My hosts were kind enough to order lot's of tofu and vegetable for me. But yes there were duck feet in the pot.
