China has a very diverse culture around food, and consists roughly of 4 major cuisines. One of them is the Sichuan kitchen, which is also often known as one of the best. It's the one I know best and have learnt to love.

Whenever I go to China, I look forward to the divers, colorful, and very tasty food.
