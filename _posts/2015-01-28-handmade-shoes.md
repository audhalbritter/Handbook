This might sound a bit snobish, but I just go my second pair of handmade shoes. I got my first pair a few month ago and I would never give them back. It's like with everything, once you have the chance to compare a quality product with a "commercial" product, you can see (and with shoes) feel the difference. You understand why they cost a little bit more and why your grandparents did not have to buy shoes every other week (well there were also no supermarkets back then).

The other thing I like about handmade products are the small details, the sign that somebody cared about the thing he created. There are for example some wise (I think) words written on the sole of my shoes. I would like to know what it means, who speaks Italian?
