After a relaxing weekend with sunbathing and swimming, I am back in the field again. I have one last trip before my holidays! It's time that I go, because everyone around me is away. Summer holiday in Norway is the most important thing (one of the most important things). At the moment, nobody is around that I can ask where things are or how I book this, where should I put that. Never  start a position right before everybody leaves on their summer holidays (remember for next time!).

Another splendid summer day today and I start to wonder if I my plane has taken me in the wrong direction: south?
