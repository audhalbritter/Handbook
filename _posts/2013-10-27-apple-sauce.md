The other day I went to the shop and wanted to by apple sauce. But all they had was weight watcher apple sauce. No, I wanted the real stuff. So I decided to buy apples and make it myself. Can't be that hard. And actually it is very easy. It took me 30min.

Then I got enthusiastic about it and carved a <a href="http://www.etsy.com/de/listing/167109924/apfelmus-stempel?ref=shop_home_active">stamp</a>, cut out a piece of fabric for the lid and made the label. Cute, I look forward to the next meal where I can use apple sauce. By the way, I don't like the english work for apple sauce, so I used the german word for the stamp!
