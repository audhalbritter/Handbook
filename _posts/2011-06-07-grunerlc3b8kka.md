Yesterday we had a few hours in Oslo. The place I like best in Oslo is Grünerløkka a historic neighbourhood. There are many nice shops, restaurants and coffee shops. Here a little selection:

1. <a href="http://www.skaperverket.no/">skaperverket</a> - A nice shop where you can find little nice books, art, post cards, jewlery, cloth and toys.

2. <a href="http://www.bugges.net/">Bugges</a> - A little restaurant at the corner of Markveien. The place is decorated like a living room, they have an excellent Vegi burger and offer catering.

3. <a href="http://www.sprell.no/">Sprell</a> - Wonderworld for kids with wonderful toys of wood.

4. <a href="http://www.palaisdesthes.com/en/shops/shop-store-tea-oslo-olaf-ryes.htm">Le Palais de thés shop</a> - A tea shop at Olaf Ryes place. Very friendly service and some of the best tees.
