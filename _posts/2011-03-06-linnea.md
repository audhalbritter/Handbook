These books about the girl Linnéa are written by two Swedish women. Christina Björk is writing and Lena Anderson drawing. One book is about how Linnéa goes to Paris with her grandfather and discovers the world of Claude Monet. Another book is about Linnéas passion: plants. And she tells you how and what she plants in her garden with the help of an old gardener. I love them.
