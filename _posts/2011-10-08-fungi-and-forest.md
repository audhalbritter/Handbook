Yesterday I found the perfect piece of forest. It is somewhere in in the French part of Switzerland close to Payern. The area is a <a href="http://www.pilzreservat.ch/de/index.html">reserve for fungi</a> and includes a natural trail with information about champion, chantarelle and all the others. We saw a lot of fungi. Unfortunately we don't know many of them but we recoginzed boletus (<em>Boletus edulis)</em> and fly agaric (<em>Amanita muscaria var. muscaria</em>).

Anyway we entered a small forst trail, it went darker and we came to a little bridge. Suddenly I felt this is the perfect forest. I looked aroud expecting Ronja the Robber's Daugther, Tom Bombadil or Hansel and Gretel to appear at anytime.
