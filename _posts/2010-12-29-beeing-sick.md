Hi there. Being sick on Christmas is not the best thing, or maybe it is. However if you're power leaves you, and you're not able to open your gifts then things get bad. Luckily I got a light present and I gave a heavy one. So unwrapping this picture (original) of a 2cv was easy and I just managed. It's a screen printing from <a href="http://www.anna-flores.com/index.html">Anna Flores</a>... I love it.
