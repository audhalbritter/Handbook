Writing a paper can be a very long process, especially if it is one of your first papers. But finally it is out. This paper is about the <a href="http://aud.li/2010/06/10/there-and-back-again/">field survey</a> I did in summer 2010 in Scandinavia and Switzerland, where I made a lot of nice pictures. The reason is that I surveyed road sites for days and carried my camera everywhere around with me.

Please let me know if you would like to read the paper...
