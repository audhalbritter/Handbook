Starting the year in the sun was a good strategy last year and we decided to repeat it. Yesterday, we arrived on Fuerteventura. Lately, we have discovered Airbnb and are living in house in a small village called Camino Casillas del Morales, far away from all the tourist. We cannot see the ocean, but have stunning volcanic landscape around us. It was a bit difficult to find the place, since it seems that you can pick any house number you want for your house. Next to 28 is 109 and then 74. No structure at all. Last night we went to the beach for a wonderful sunset.

Today, we drove westwards, over a mountain pass to a small village called Betancuria. This was Fuerteventuras capital until 1834. It was built hidden between the mountains to escape attacks from European and Moroccan pirates. Today, itâ€™s a cosy place with white houses and well attended gardens and is worthwhile to visit. After that we visited Ayju, a small village at a stunning beach with black sand.
