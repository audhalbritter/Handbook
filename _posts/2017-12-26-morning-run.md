I love to live in the city centre, to have everything close by, get a coffee, walk to the shop and go for a stroll in the centre. It's convenient to have everything very close. And in Bergen you can have the city and right by your house.

But I also like to live in the countryside. Not having any neighbours, hearing the birds sing and seeing animals from the window. The Tiny House in Buechberg is such a place and I love spending time here. It is great to wake up and be able to walk out of the door and start jogging. This morning was lovely even with some sun.
