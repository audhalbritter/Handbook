But you could say that I am a theaholic. I like a coffee from our new brilliant coffee machine or from the Phoenix coffee shop in Ørsta. But let's talk about coffee another time. Now it's teatime! I drink tea all the time.

Some weeks ago I ordered a tea in a restaurant. And the little label on the teabag said: L'art de thé. I was curious where this tea was from and googled the name. And I found a teashop in Luzern. The homepage of this teashop is very nice and I decided to visit the shop as soon as possible. Last Wednesday I grabbed some papers I had to read and took the train to Luzern.

<a href="http://www.art-du-the.ch/htmlde/home.htm">L'art du thé</a> is the most wonderful teashop I have ever seen. It is quiet large and you can buy everything you wish for. The lady in the shop took her time to show me around. I bought my only christmas present for this year and got a tea while waiting for her to wrap the gift. I wish I could go there every day.
