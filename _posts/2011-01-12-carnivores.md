I made a shocking discovery in the greenhouse today. I have carnivorous plants! This means they eat animals. And it's a common weed in Switzerland (<em>Senecio viscosus</em>). If I stop blogging you know I'll be eaten by my plants.

The secret is that they have little hairs that release a gluey liquid that traps the insects.
