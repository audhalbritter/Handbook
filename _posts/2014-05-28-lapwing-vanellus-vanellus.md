Today we drove through the Highlands (the Scottish Mountains). There were clouds, a tiny bit of rain and fog. This was what we had expected to experience the whole time. We went for a walk and after 5 minutes we saw the first lapwing!

Lapwings occur in wetlands. They are mainly black (tinted green) and white with a crest on the head. The wings are black with a white end and white on the under side. They have a peculiar, erratic way of flying, to which its name refers.
