When I am traveling I always regret that I don't own a wide-angle lense. Taking landscape photos with a normal lense is just not the same. Lanzarote has some amazing landscapes. The whole island is covered in smaller and larger volcanos of different colours. Luckily, I am traveling with Mr. K who let's me use his superduper lense if I ask very nicely.

Some shot's from the centre of the island.
