My mum and aunt have a few hobbies. One is collecting fire wood (nothing strange in Norway). Another hobby is to collect bottles with deposits along the road sides. TheyÂ are saving the money for some bottles of wine.

Today, I went on a bottle collecting trip with my aunt. We walked about 500m along the main road and found bottles worth 48 NOK. It's amazing what people throw away along the road. But imagine if we would walk all the thousands of kilometers of roads in the country, how rich would we get! The catch of the day was a coke can with an advertisement from the olympic games 1988 in Seoul.

Conclusions: Norwegians drink Hansa beer and cans don't decay!
