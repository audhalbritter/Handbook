I'm in Arizona to collaborate with colleagues from Tucson. Last time I was here I realized that the Grand Canyon is actually not that far away, but it was still too far for a day trip. So, this time around I decided to spend a few days in Northern Arizona at the Canyon.

I spent two days walking along the southern Rim. The Rim could be done quicker of course, and walking down into the Canyon would have been nice to get a better impression of the size of the Canyon. And much less people are going down as it is a pretty intensive hike.Â With the snow and icy paths it was also bit sketchy and gravity seems to work extremely well at the Grand Canyon.

Yesterday, I spent a day in the rain around Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon looking at red rocks and lots of interesting plants. I was not expecting to see Norwegian standard waterfalls in the desert.
