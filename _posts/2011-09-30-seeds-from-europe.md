The good thing about my project is that at the moment I get a lot of parcels; almost every day. Earlier this year I asked several researchers in Europe to help me collect seeds. It's a bit cheeper and greener than travelling around and do it myself. And now all the seeds arrive in different shapes. Yesterday I got a book about the botanic garden in Oslo. Today I got a green parcel with seeds from <em>Plantago major</em> and a lovely letter from Jokkmokk. And I am still waiting for a parcel form Island!
