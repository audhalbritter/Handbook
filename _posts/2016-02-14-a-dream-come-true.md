I have always wanted to ski and be able to see the ocean. This dream came true yesterday. We went skiitouring on Gullfjellet, a 30 minutes drive from Bergen. It was a perfect day, sunny and ice cold. My fingers alomst froze and I had to shake my arms to get the fealing back. We started to walk and after a beacon training half way up the mountain we reached the top. When we finally looked back, we could see the Atlantic ocean! This was a very special moment, because I have always dreamed of this experience.

Thanks Francesca for a wonderful day and makeing our dreams come true!
