"Life with metal and fire" is the moto of the blacksmith <a href="https://www.lampert-guarda.ch/">Lampert-Guarda</a>. They are situated in the Eastern Swiss Alps, in a small village in the Engadin.

One of their products are beautiful handmade knifes. I recently bought a ham knife, with a 12cm blade and a wooden handle.

The knife was delivered in a black box on a alpine meadow bed :-)
