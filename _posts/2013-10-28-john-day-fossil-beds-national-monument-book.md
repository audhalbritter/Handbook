I found this book about the John Day Monument in a shop in Portland. It's the work of Â <a href="http://www.fantomforest.com/about.html">Matt Sundstrom</a>. I like the simple drawings and everything is explained in a few words. We had the book with us when we visited the Painted Hills. Great guide! Here are some more of his books about <a href="http://www.fantomforest.com/books.html">Oregon</a>.
