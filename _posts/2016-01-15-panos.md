This was the last day and tomorrow it goes back to ZÃ¼rich. The snow has come at last in Switzerland. I'm looking forward to go home (I always do). And maybe there will be a bit of skiing before I go back to Bergen. This time it will be via Turku in Finland (where I have only been once for 10 minutes). Sonja, maybe you remeber...

But here some panos from Fuerte and Lanzarote. As always we loved it and intend to come back. But this time with a goal. We want to learn to surf.
