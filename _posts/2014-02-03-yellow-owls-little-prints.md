My newest acquirement is "Yellow Owl's Little Prints" by Christine Schmidt. I love the design and all the products from <a href="http://www.yellowowlworkshop.com/">Yellow Owl Workshop</a>. They make greeting cards, stamp sets, ink pads (I use them all the time) and many more.

This new book presents little workshops for you and your kids. It's organized in categories such as Celebrate, Play or Wear. At the end of the book there are many templates you can use if you are not the best drawer (like me). I look forward to start a project very soon, maybe to print a Sweater for my nephew or make adorable labels for the next birthday child.
