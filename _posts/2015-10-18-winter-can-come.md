I do like all seasons and going from summer directly to winter would be too quick. Autumn is great. I like the colouring of the leaves, drinking warm tea inside and staring knitting again. But this year, winter cannot come fast enough for me. The reason is that I have a pair of brand new ski's and I can't wait to test them.

Last season I was introduced to off piste skiing (outside the slope) in deep and fresh snow. This was lot's of fun, because we there was plenty of snow in western Norway. I know, I have been complaining about the snow in the mountains all summer, but now I wish for a lot of snow again, and very very soon!
