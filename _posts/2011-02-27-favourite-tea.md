I recently wrote about a<a href="http://aud.li/2011/02/15/tea-plant/"> tea seminar</a> I've made. I bought a black tea and it's my favourite tea now. It's from the tea garden Idulgashinna in Ceylon. This tea garden has a project for sustainability in the tea production. You can buy the tea here: <a href="http://www.art-du-the.ch/">l'art du th√©</a>.
