"Viltvoksende og velsmakende" is a beautifully illustrated book from Nadia NÃ¶rbom about edible plants and other knowledge how plants can be used. The book describes how to recognize the plants, where the plants grow, when to harvest, about taste and smell, how to use and cook them, storage and medical use.

I have wanted to learn more about how to use the thousands of plants around us for a long time. I usually study them and use them in my experiments. But which plants we can eat and how can they help to prevent illnesses. I believe that nature has a lot more to give and a lot of this knowledge has been lost over time. Maybe I can learn a bit more with this book.
