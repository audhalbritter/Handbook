We've spent the last week in Håvoll at my aunt's place. There is no internet and therefore it's been so quiet here. We have been fishing, relaxing, spent some time at our favourite cafe the Phønix and visited Ålesund. But last night we took the bus to Oslo. It's rainy but there is a lot going on and we look forward to explore Grünerlökka, Grønland, Frognar and a lot more...
