I am back in Norway for ten days. This is my last field season and I have to plant, measure and check what survived the winter. I am in Trondheim for 3 days and then travel north again to Troms√∏. Trondheim welcomed me with sun and rain at the same time as usual. But it felt very real.

To be vegetarian is not so easy in every country. In Norway it is mostly ok but as you go further north and away from cities it gets more complicated. But Mr. K. and I have started to search for vegetarian restaurants wherever we go and it has proved to be successful. I did the same today and found this nice place in the city center called <a href="http://persilleriet.no/">persilleriet</a>. They serve mostly healthy, local and organic food.
