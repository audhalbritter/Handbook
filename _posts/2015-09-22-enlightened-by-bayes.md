Last week I was at a summer school on <a href="http://www.eecrg.uib.no/BayesCourse/">Bayesian Statistics</a>. I had a wonderful and tough time, trying to remember all these mathematic stuff, but I learnt a lot and was definitely "enlightened" by Bayes! I will try to apply this to my own data in the near future.

The course was at the <a href="http://www.muho.no/lyngheisenteret">Lyngheisenteret</a> on Lygra a island north of Bergen. We were spoiled by the cook and the weather (we went swimming!).

The course is run every year and I can only recommend it.
