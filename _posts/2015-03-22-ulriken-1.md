On Saturday I made it to one of "The Seven". The Seven are seven mountains surrounding Bergen. It is an ongoing discussion, which seven mountains that belong to The Seven, or are there five or nine? And depending on who you ask and where they live, you'll get different answers. I don't want to go into this discussion here, but I will hike some of the mountains surrounding Bergen. Also the numbers don't mean anything other than the order that I'll hike them;-)

Ulriken is the highest of the mountains (643m). A steep and rocky trail leads up to the top. From the top one can see the open ocean and snowy mountain tops towards the east.
