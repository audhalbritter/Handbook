I found this old reading book in a thrift shop the other day. I've been looking for hard cover books that have a nice cover page. The idea is to add blank pages and make a notebook. First, I rip out the old pages, very carefully. Then I bind blank pages together to small booklets and stich them together. Note to future me: I should make a video tutorial how to do this! And finally the pages are glued into the book. Done.

Soon, notebooks will be available in my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/audli?ref=search_shop_redirect">etsy shop</a>.

And let me know if you have nice old books!
