We did not want to drive around in the US like crazy. But that is exactly what we are doing right now. On one hand this country (we have only visited two states and yes they are two of the bigger states) is very large. In Switzerland we think twice if we have to drive for like 20 minutes. Here a 4h drive is normal. And I can see why this is the case now. I already new this, but you easily forget these things, when you live in tiny country.

Oregon has approximately the size of the United Kingdom or Ecuador. Especially in the Eastern part you have to drive far to see things. And now the situation gets even more complicated because the government closed down all national forests and parks, because of a political game. I might not understand what is going on here, but I don't really get the point of all this. People who don't get payed, parks closing down and then they get payed to check that nobody enters the parks...

Anyway we did not go to Crater Lake and headed directly to Bend. Here we spent two nights going to the Bend Film Festival, finding new coffee roasters and walking in the desert. Today we drove again for several hours (I don't even dare to tell you how many) and visited the most exciting place of all times. But I won't tell you until next time!
