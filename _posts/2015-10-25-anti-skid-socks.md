I have wanted to try this for a while. And because I am knitting socks for my niece I needed to make them anti skid. She starts to walk now and needs a good grip on her feet.

Since I had bought an anti skid kit I tried it out on my own socks. It's super easy: apply the paste on the socks and wait!
