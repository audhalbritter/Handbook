It has become a tradition to start the year somewhere warm and sunny (life if full of traditions!). Well, we are back on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote for two weeks. Besides answering a few help calls from Norway and reading a paper or two, we are driving around the islands, drinking coffee, visiting lovely towns, eating cake and we had a surf lesson yesterday! This was the first time I was surfing and I really love it. The water was so warm, we could surf for several hours. I managed to stand on the board a couple of times and we are going back to the beach tomorrow!
