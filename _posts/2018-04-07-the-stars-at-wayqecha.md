It is time for me to say goodbye to a wonderful country. When I left for Peru, I was overworked and stressed because I had to organize a 2 weeks course in a country I knew nothing of, with people I barely knew from a few emails and skype calls. And I did not have time to read anything about the country, the history and it's people. I packed my bag, jumped on a plane and arrived in Cusco, without having slept much on the journey.

My first glance at Cusco and the surrounding mountains changed everything. I saw snowy peaks, greener than green fields and brown houses. The city was loud and the sun was shining. It warmed my heart. And everything after that has just been a dream. Everybody I met in Peru was extremely friendly and helpful. (Almost) Everything I needed, was organized without any difficulties. I learnt an important lesson, "In Peru, everything is possible".

And finally, travelling in Peru has been super nice. I'm very relaxed, I'm sad to leave, but also ready to go home and to work again!

And I start to wonder, how many times can you leave your heart in a place, before nothing is left? I hope indefinitely...
