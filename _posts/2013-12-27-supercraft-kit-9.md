I always intended to tell you more about the <a href="http://www.supercraftlab.de">supercraft</a> kits. I think I did it once but then never mentioned what I had done with it or what was in it...

Well here is what I found in the winter <a href="http://www.supercraftlab.de/kits/">kit #9</a>:

It was all about making and wrappingÂ gifts; gift wrap paper, stamps to stamp blank gift wrap paper, a blank ribbon to stamp, a calendar with space to create a personal calendar, a cookie recipe, lot's of ideas how to decorate a gift, instruction how to make a potato stamp, paint and an ink pad for all the stamps.

There is always a small booklet with a few ideas what you can do, but actually everything is allowed. The good thing about getting several of these kits it that your DIY supplies are getting larger and you can combine materials from different kits!

You can get new year kit #10 <a href="http://www.supercraftlab.de/kits/">here</a>.
