I have forgotten that Oregon can be really hot in summer. It is sunny and between 35 and 40°C everyday. We have traveled from Mt. Hood to Bend, Crater Lake and are spending 2 days in Ashland.

Bend reminds me of Voss, because it is an outdoor city. You can do all sorts of outdoor activity; hiking, biking, kayaking and skiing in winter. We went for a short hike in the heat and cooled down with iced coffee.

Today, we visited Crater Lake. When we were here in 2013, the park was closed due to the <em>government</em> <em>shutdown</em><span style="font-size: 20px;">. But this time we made it to the blue lake.</span><a href="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CraterLake2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4017" src="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CraterLake2-1024x548.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="482" /></a> <a href="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MG_7613.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4018" src="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MG_7613-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a> <a href="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MG_7630.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4019" src="http://aud.li/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/MG_7630-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" /></a>

In the afternoon, we drove south to Ashland. On our last trip to Oregon we discovered Ashland by chance and liked this charming little town in the middle of the desert so much that we had to come back. Tonight, we are spending the night in a tent.
