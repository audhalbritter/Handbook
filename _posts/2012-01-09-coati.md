I've got a coati (Nasenb√§r) in my office tracking every movement I do.

Click <a href="http://www.horrorvacui.it/temp/coati3d.jpg">here</a> (http://www.horrorvacui.it/temp/coati3d.jpg) to download the pattern, print, cut, fold and glow and you'll have a cute friend following your doing.

Instructions: Hold the coati at eye height, close one eye and the head of the coati should pop out. Now move the coati to the right and left and the eyes should follow you everywhere.
