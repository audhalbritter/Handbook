I saw this wonderful picture on <a href="http://newhouseproject.com/">newhouseproject</a>Â a blog I have lately followed. I would very much like to have such a shelf to display small items. But then I don't know if it's maybe the masking tape in different colours that I'd like to have. I guess it's both...
