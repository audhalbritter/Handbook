<p style="text-align: left;">We have moved on to Lanzarote. This island is even more sparse and covered with huge lava fields. I am fascinated about the colours and plants that mange to grow under these conditions. There is approximatly 100mm of rain a year and the temperature never goes below 20Â°C.</p>
