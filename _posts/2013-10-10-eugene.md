We have spent one rainy day in Eugene. It is good to come back to a place you have been before, when you are traveling. I start to feel tired going to a new place every day trying to figure out where to sleep, where to eat, where to go next,... Don't get me wrong, all is still fine here and were are off to new adventures, but well I guess I look forward to go home, soon.

I met my Professor and a collaborator from my time at the university, and Mosby the cat. It was good to see these people after such a long time. There are so many little things you forget about people you haven't seen for a long time.

Yesterday I tried to show Mr. K. Eugene. But I think he was a bit disappointed. Well there is not so much to see, I must admit. No offense, there are a few nice places, but not Eugene downtown. Finally, we went for a pice of cake to Sweet Life. I have waited 5 years for this moment. They still make the best cake!

It is autumn here. The leaves turn yellow and red and the temperature has dropped. In hope to get a last bit of summer, we drove all the way to Ashland today. This is in Southern Oregon at the Californian border. The vegetation has changed a lot, it's drier and sunny. But the air is cold. From here we will cross the Cascade Mountains and go back to Portland through eastern Oregon. A burning desire of mine!
