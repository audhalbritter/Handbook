Life at high elevation is harsh and often a fight for survival. Strong winds, low temperature and snow in summer are common. It is therefore fascinating to see what species have adapt to grow at these elevations.

Today we did field work at 4200m. We had to walk the last couple of meters and I could feel the elevation with every step. We recorded phenology and I had time to explore the beauties growing in this harsh environment.
