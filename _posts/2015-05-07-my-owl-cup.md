I got an owl cup the other day from someone who has recently been to Olympia (thanks!!!). Now I enjoy my aeropress or V60 every day in this new cup. I think people smile at me, when they see what a big fuss I make out of a simple cup of coffee. Weighing in beans, the water and measuring the time the water needs to run through the filter. If they only knew...
