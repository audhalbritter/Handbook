Today, tea from <a href="http://www.al-canton.ch/">Al Canton</a> arrived. We have bought tea there for <a href="http://aud.li/2011/09/26/tea-time/">years</a>. And since last time they have changed the packing from plastic to paper. And the new design is lovely. Nice colours and drawings from the plants in the tea.

"Al canton" means in the corner. It is the name of the farm and that is also were it is located: in the furtest corner of the Swiss Alps. They have horses and grow tea herbs. What a life!
