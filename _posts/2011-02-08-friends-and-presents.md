It's good to have friends abroad. And it's also good to have a favorite animal in each country. I am talking about Zambia and guinea fowls. Sometimes I send some chocolate to my dear friends in Zambia. And I always get something back. Because I fell in love with these nice but stupid bird guinea fowls it has always something to do with them. This time it's a guinea fowl cup.

Thanks!
