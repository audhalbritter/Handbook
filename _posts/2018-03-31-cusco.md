After one month in Cusco I have learnt to love this place. Cusco is loud and a bit crowded, but very charming in it's own way. You find extremely good Peruvian and foreign food. And people in Cusco are very friendly, despite all the tourist that visit the city every day.

I like especially the San Blas area located north of the centre on the hillside. The charming streets are steep and full of small artsy shops, restaurants and cafés. One of my favourites is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lateliercafeconcept/">L'atelier Café Concept</a>, a lovely shop and café.
