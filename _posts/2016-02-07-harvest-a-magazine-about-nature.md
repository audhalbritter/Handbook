<a href="http://harvest.as/harvest/om">Harvest</a> is a quality nett magazine (in Norwegian) about nature and our behavour towards nature, because "<em>Nature does not need us but we are nothing without it</em>". The makers also see it as a bonfire where stories are told. And the stories are diverse. Adventures, expeditions, philosophy and science. See for yourself!
