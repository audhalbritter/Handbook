The days are getting shorter and darker. Not really shorter but that's how everybody is describing autumn. Anyway you be wanting to stay inside and make yourself a hot drink. Today I tried to make a Chai tea latte. It was not really perfect but I made black tea and added cardamom and cloves. I had only cardamom pulver. Probably pods would be better. You can sweeten your tea with honey and then add milk and heat all together for a few minutes.

Enjoy!
