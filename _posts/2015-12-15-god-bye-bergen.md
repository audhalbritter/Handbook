I will soon be on my way back to Switzerland. 6 weeks with family and friends. Hopefully a little skiing. I need to find out if my ski's can manage the Alps or is it the other way round (?), probably. Then we go and catch the sun on an sandy, dusty island in the Atlantic. More of this later...

For now, god bye Bergen. Why do you always have to make it so difficult to leave you! Sunshine and snowy mountains!
