Living abroad and traveling makes you think about what and where home is. I have called a lot of places home over the past years and I have tried to distinguish them by saying "home", "home home", etc. But I realized that home is something different. Somebody else would probably explain home differently, but for me is has three different meanings.

Home is a place where I can be by myself. There are usually things that I love, books, music, camera, my monkey. And it is the place I sleep and eat and go when I need to be alone, to think and drink a cup of tea.

Home is also the place where I have loved once. A place were I love to return to. My heart beats faster when I think about the place and when I go there. It can be memories from the childhood or new places I have learnt to love.

The third kind of home for me is nature. Being in nature can be so beautiful that it makes my heart jump. Hiking over a meadow, standing on a mountain, seeing the ocean after a long journey, skiing a slope in powder, walking through a magical forrest, looking at a glacier or swim in a fjord. All these things make me feel alive and strong. But at the same time I get this awareness that earth is our home, this beautiful planet that is the only home we have.

Home, for me is a feeling and it always comes from the heart.

This beautiful documentary by Jordan Manley has inspired me to think about what home means for me.
