Since my bird course last spring, I also stop and try to identify all the birds that I spot. Some of the birds are easy, because they are European birds overwintering on the Canary Islands, like the common kestrel (<em>Falco tinnuculus</em>). Others are new to us: atlanticÂ canary (<em>Serinus canaria</em>), barbary partridge (<em>Alectoris barbara</em>) on El Hierro and blue chaffinch (<em>Fringilla tedea</em>).
