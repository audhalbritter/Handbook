We have left Port Angeles behind and driven west towards the coast. We past Forks with the Twilight mania and found some very remote beaches. The waves were pretty high and did not invite for swimming. Last night we parked our Camper facing the ocean. It got cold at night but in the morning we could watch the waves from our bed:-)

I used the tripod to take the pictures from the sunset and was amazed how much more color you can get with a longer exposure.
