This is our new chest of drawer. It was built some time ago, but the sheep and pig buttons have just arrived. The whole chest of drawer was carefully planed, made and painted. It is specially designed to fit under the big TV screen. The drawers are takenÂ from an IKEA cupboard. The lower drawer is shorter than the upper drawer, so that the plug socket on the wall does not come in the way.

So now we have a sheep and a pig in the living room, watching us, watching GoT.
