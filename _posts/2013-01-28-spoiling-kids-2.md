Memory game, a classic. But even better when you make it yourself. I got the inspiration <a href="http://www.scandinaviandeko.com/">here</a>. It's possible to buy these white cards, but you can also make them yourself by painting a piece of cardboard, cut round or square pieces and then every family member can make their memory card pairs. It will be even more fun and challenging when mum or dad paints one memory cardÂ and the kid the matching card:-)
