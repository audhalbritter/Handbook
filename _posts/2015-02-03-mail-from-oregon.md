Today I got mail, real mail!

On our trip to the <a href="http://aud.li/2013/08/27/back-on-the-road/">Pacific Northwest </a>over a year ago, I found a little <a href="http://aud.li/2013/10/28/john-day-fossil-beds-national-monument-book/">book</a> about the painted hills by illustrator <a href="http://www.fantomforest.com/about.html">Matt Sundstrom</a>. I liked it very much and used it as a guide when we visited the place. Matt Sundstrom has a few other books including illustrations from Portland (PDX) and a boat trip on Crater Lake. I ordered something else, which I will tell you about later (it's a birthday gift...) and got 3 little books in addition, thanks!

Looking forward to our next Oregon trip to Crater Lake!
