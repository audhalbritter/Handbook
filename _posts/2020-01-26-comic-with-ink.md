I recently read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_%28comics%29">Bone</a> comic by Jeff Smith and got really into it. The story and the "bone creatures" are great, but I also fell in love with the beautiful drawings. I like how black is used as a contrast, night scenes and sometimes black and white are simply reversed. So, I've been making some drawings from the Bone comic, using my new toy drawing ink. I like it, because using the ink the black parts really get pitch black.
