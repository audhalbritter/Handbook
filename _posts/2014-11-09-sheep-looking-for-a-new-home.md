This is Shawn the sheep and he is moving to London. He is not very fluffy because he is knitted with <a href="http://www.muho.no/lyngheisenteret">Lygra</a> wild sheep wool. But the wool is 100% biologically produced in Norway. He is looking forward to go to London and hopes for green pastures and less rain.

The animal knitting patterns are by <a href="http://fluffandfuzz.weebly.com/">Amanda Berry</a>.
