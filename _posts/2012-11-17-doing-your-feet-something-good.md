I love to take a footbath. So I bougth myself a big orange pot for that purpose. Some time ago I found a honey foot care from <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/2012/09/small-measures-honey-foot-care.html">Design Sponge</a>. Today was the perfect day to give my feet a nice treat!

Fill a bucket with water. Add 2 spoons with apple vinegar, honey and slices of lemon. Bath your feet for 15min. Then add the sugar-honey foot scrub: brown sugar, coconut oil (but I used a massage oil that I had left), 2 spoons of honey and 3 drops of peppermint essential oil (I used lavendel oil).

Your feet will love it!
