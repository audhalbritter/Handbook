I am not a big fan of travelling in large and organized groups. But sometimes it is easier to join a group to get to certain places. This is what we did at Titicaca Lake. And it was fun. I did a little research to find a company that offers tours other than the standard tourist trip and works with local people.

First, we took a boat to isla Taquile and visited the local knitters and weavers. Apparently, the best knitters in the world come from this island. Knitting is a mens business, the women weave.

The next stop was Santa Maria, on the Capachica Peninsula. There we tried a local dish called"Pachamanca", which is fish, chicken, potatoes and vegetables cooked under a pile of stones and soil.

Finally, we visited the floating islands, isla Uros Ccapi. This island is more remote than others and less visited. About 25 people live on a 40m2 floating island made of dried totora reed. It takes about 1.5 years to make an island and only Uros people are allowed to make them. More and more young people leave the islands to live on the mainland and this is likely to be the last generation living on the floating islands.
