Next week, I will go to Kristiansand to film the next statistic videos. I have briefly talked about this <a href="http://aud.li/2015/11/30/filmstar/">before</a>. Until the end of the week we have to finish writing the scripts, making slides and learning the script. So, we are wokring very hard to get it done.

The videos are about explaining distributions and we (Joachim) have produced a couple ofÂ  nice animations to show that. Basically, the animations loop through (this is R language) all sorts of things: ylim, xlim, colours, length,... and it drives me crazy. Have a look yourself.
