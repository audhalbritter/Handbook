Music - honestly I have no clue about music and I want to change that. We have an awful lot of CD's at home (they're not mine!). So I decided to listen to all of them in alphabetical order. What an idea! Now I could listen to one CD a day and then tell you which CD I had been listening to and you would all get bored very soon. Once a month I would choose my favourite song and each year I would make a best of playlist. And some years later I would look back and punch myself for doing such a stupid thing. Hopefully someone would have stoped me earlier.

I will listen to all these songs quietly by myself. And from time to time when I make a real discovery I'll tell you... In the mean time I'll informe you about more interessting things. So today I started the whole thing with A like A fine frenzy / One cell in the sea.
