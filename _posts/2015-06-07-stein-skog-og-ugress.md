Today, I went on a hike with Mari to check out a mountain cabin where she will celebrate her birthday with some friends. The weather was miserable but this did not matter after the shoes were soaked.

We passed Rundemanen (mountain top #3) and wandered around Øvre Jordalsvatne without view. We came to the cabin and met two men, who were fixing up the place. We got coffee and they started to talk about the lack of summer, hiking in the mountains around Bergen and gardening. And then one of them suddenly described western Norway in three words: stein, skog og ugress (stone, woods and weed).
