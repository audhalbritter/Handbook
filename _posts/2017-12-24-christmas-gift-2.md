For the last couple of weeks I have painted and water coloured a 23 page story. And it has become a little book. The story is an adventure of Lisa and Tim and their friend the blue butterfly, who is kidnapped and locked away in the highest tower of a castle. <span style="color: #3f3f3f; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal;">The story is full of adventure, magic creatures and suspense.</span><span style="color: #3f3f3f; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal;"> </span><span style="font-size: 20px;">Will Lisa and Tim find the blue butterfly again, and who is going to help them?</span>

It is a Chirstmas gift for my nephew and nice.

PS: In case you are still looking for a gift for a little fellow, let me know and I can send you a pdf of the story. It's in Norwegian!
