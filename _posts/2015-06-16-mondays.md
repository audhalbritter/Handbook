Why we don't like Mondays?

Maybe because things like that only happen on Mondays! I got up a little after 5 to drive 3 hours to one of my field sites. Four hours counting flowers, wearing thights because it was ice cold. It's June! Even up here this means summer. On the way home a tractor had a flat tire and we waited for over one hour to pass. Then John Snow died which made everything much worse. Finally I ended up waiting four hours on the night train in Voss and missed the connection to GÃ¶teborg...

Well I'm in Oslo now. The sun is shining and it' Tuesday!
