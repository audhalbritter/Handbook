I have my analog Zeiss Ikon Contraflex camera with me on Fuerteventura. Analog photography is fun and yes, itâ€™s also very hip. But it reminds me of the days when everything was analog, I like the sound the camera makes when you take a picture and the fact that you cannot see the picture emediatly. It takes a couple of weeks before the developed film comes back, which is the best part of it. But I still find myself looking at the back of the camera and wondering why I cannot see the picture...
