I have finally done it! I went to a Yoga class in Portland. After 5 weeks doing nothing really. I don't count walking between 10'000 and 20'000 steps a day. It was a great Hatha Yoga class with 12 people. The class was for all levels but I was surprised that I have not become as stiff as a stick yet!
