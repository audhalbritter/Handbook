Some weeks ago I thought this is the last day of skiing before the summer. But it turned out I was wrong, because last week the summer ski center on the Folgafonna glacier opened. And there we went.

After driving through the beautiful Hardanger we arrived at the foot of the glacier. There is so much snow, that the road has at least 3m snow on each side. The weather was sunny, foggy and snowy and you could feel the cold icy air from the glacier when skiing down.

On the way home we missed the ferry by 2 minutes (despite the rally), and spent some time botanizing (got crash course in mosses) and had soft ice.

Takk for en kjempefin tur Mari!
