I finished the field work in Tromsø today. I saved taking pictures until today because the sun was supposed to be shining. It did for about 30 minutes. It felt good and was almost too warm because I was wrapped like an onion in 4 layers with a hat and gloves. But then it vanished again and it even started to rain. Good for the plants that I just planted I thought! But I managed some shoots in this half hour.

I hope the birds will leave the colored sticks I made and carefully placed in each plot. Last year they stole a lot of labels. And Gregor, the guy that sowed the seeds for me, had to rescue them.
