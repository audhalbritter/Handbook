We reached Vågan, the rain stoped, the sun shone. Passed Svolvær, will visit it tomorrow. Arrived in Kabelvåg, went for a short walk, enjoyed the sun. Found a cafe, had a cafe. Fell in love with the cafe. Wanted to have it. Went on, enjoyed the view, walked the streets. Found a nice blue house. Fell in love with it as well. Aspecially the askew dore. Went shopping, ate dinner, enjoyed the sun, blogged. The day will not end, the sun is still shining.
