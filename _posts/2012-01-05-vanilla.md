I just got a bunch of vanilla pod from the jungle (from a friend who spent 4 month doing field work in Madagascar). My finger smell, the whole office smells. Good yes, but very intense. I put the pods in a plastic bag that they don't dry out. What will I do with them? Vaniila cream, a cake, ...? Any ideas?

Did she meet Alex, Marty and their friends? No, they were already gone to Africa and are running around in Europe at the moment but she got a glimpse ofÂ  the lemur king Julian!
