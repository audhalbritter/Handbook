I wish I had not already made an advent calendar. But there is always next year, right? I made my calendar, inspired from the <a href="http://www.supercraftlab.de/">autumn supercraft kit</a>. Cute little black and white boxes, which I folded. Little did I know, that I would soon find the most awesome advent calendar ever on the <a href="http://diyordie.elleinterior.se/inspirerande-julkalendrar/">DIY or DIE</a> blog.

My nephew will almost be two next Christmas. I bet he'll love it!
