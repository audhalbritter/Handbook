I think we were very lucky with the weather in Seattle. It was only raining half of the time. The owner of the boat we lived on called the weather interesting. I guess it should always be raining, this time of the year.

On Thursday we took the train from Seattle to Portland. It took 3 hours and 40 minutes. I thought it would be a long train ride, because by that time you can cross Switzerland diagonally. But the train ride was short. Maybe we have developed a different feeling of time. A girl sitting behind us was constantly on the phone trying to get some information or transaction done. I didn't get it. But by the end we reached Portland we new all her personal details.

It feels good to be back in Oregon. Portland is treating us well with blue sky sunshine and the temperature is back in the 70's now. So far we have wandered around in the city, checking out coffee shops, stores and eating lunch in a park in the sun.
