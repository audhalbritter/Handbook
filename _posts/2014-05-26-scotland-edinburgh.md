We arrived in Edinburgh this morning and will be in Scotland for a few days. It is our first holiday since our trip to Canada and the States last year. I am looking forward to some days of relaxing, birding, hiking, strolling, eating, drinking and enjoying. The first thing today: a coffee, what else?
