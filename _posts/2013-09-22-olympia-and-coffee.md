It should have been raining today, but the sun was shining and it is still around 70° (very funny I know, it's above 20°C). We enjoy everyday the weather man is wrong.

At the moment we are in Olympia the capital of Washington. Someone once said "Olympia is the worst city of the United States!". I would not say that, but there is really not much going on here. However, suddenly we saw a <a href="http://kevinrechsteiner.com/blog/2013/09/22/america-24-stellula-calliope/">hummingbird</a> (<em>Stellula calliope</em>) at the harbor, drinking on some red flowers. And this changed my view of the city immediately.

Also we visited the <a href="http://www.olympiacoffee.com/">Olympia Coffee Roasting Co</a> today. They are roasting coffee and we enjoyed it very much. Coffee is one of the reasons we actually went to this part of the world. And we are getting closer and closer to Coffee Land, Seattle and Portland!
