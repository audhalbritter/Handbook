This - an old circus carage - will be my new home in Switzerland! A <a href="http://tiny-house.ch/">tiny house</a> is Mr. K.'s new project and he is moving out of our loft in a couple of weeks. Besides building a house (even if it is a tiny one) on his own, the idea is to experiance how much do we need? How many things do we own and never use? How much space do we really need? And does a simple life work for me?

The space is limited and we are reducing our belongings. And this is fun and a relief! I have so many things I never use and don't really want to have and it is a good feeling to give them away. We are not throwing away everything, but trying to give them to people who like them or need them.

All of this is a bit scary but also fun and I am excited how it will turn out. You can follow the project <a href="http://tiny-house.ch/">here</a> (only in German).
