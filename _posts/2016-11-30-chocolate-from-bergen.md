<a href="http://kaffebrenneri.de.gpu.no/">Bergen Kaffebreneriet</a> has started to produce their own chocolate. They have three types, named after the country the cacao beans are from. <em>Kongo</em> is a classic chocolate, with cacao beans from Virunga National Parc, where the endangered gorillas live. <em>Den Dominikanske Republiken</em> is made from fair trade cacao and contains fruits. <em>Madagaskar</em> tasts of citrus fruit and has been given away already.

I like the design and look forward to try them.
