We have crossed another chain of mountains and are now in a town called Klamath Falls. The changes in vegetations are dramatic. We have come from rain forests to a Mediterranean mountains and are now entering Oregon's dry side. It is also called Oregon's Empty Quarter, because there are fewer people and also fewer tourists. But actually one third of Oregon is desert.
