It has been raining a lot in the last few days. Not so much fun in a car which is not totally water proof. We're trying to do the best and hope for the sun to return.

We have moved south to Mount St. Helens. The big volcano that erupted 30 years ago. We visited a lava tube today, which was formed 2000 years ago. It was very cold inside and the water was dripping from the roof. The tube was as high that you could drive through with an rv.

Basically it's full of mushrooms here. The red fly amanita (<i>Amanita muscaria)</i> was everywhere. This is actually not only coffee land but also mushroom and lichen land!

Unfortunately we only got a little glimpse of Mount St. Helens. She is covered in clouds, but the snowy flank we could see for 10 seconds looked very impressive. Please come back sun!
