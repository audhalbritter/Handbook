We have started a yoga group at work. Twice a week at lunch time we go up to the roof for a 20 minute yoga class. Everybody can take their time for 20 minutes and our group has become very popular. Do we have a teacher? Yes and no! We are teaching ourselfs. Everytime somebody else is the "teacher" and gives instructions. That way our lessons are very different each time and it does not get boring.

Your probably saying now, ok if you live in a really sunny place where winters are mild and it never rains I could do this as well, but... You might not know but I am living in Bergen which is probably the most rainy place on the planet. And here is the magic. Ever since we started this group the weather has been nice and we've had an increadible dry autumne. But of course we have to find a place where we can continu very soon!
