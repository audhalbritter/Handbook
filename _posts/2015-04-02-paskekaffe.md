I am learning about Norwegian traditions, that I was not aware of before. Easter holiday is very important in Norway. People go to their huts in the mountains for skiing trips. Another tradition for coffee roaster is to produce a special coffee for special occasions such as Easter and Christmas. I bought the "påske kaffe" from Jacu and I'm very curious how it will taste.
