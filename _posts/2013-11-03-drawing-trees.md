When we were in Seattle, living on the boat for a few days, I got this very creative phase. I don't know if it was because the boat was gently rocking us into sleep or because we had a table to write, paint and draw. But I was suddenly into drawing trees.

PS: the wisdom is not from me, but copied from somebody else in the world wide web!
