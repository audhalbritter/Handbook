I have one good and one very bad excuse for why I haven't been writing in a while. And I'll give you both: First, I have been working a lot on a paper, which is still not finished (that's the bad excuse). And Mr. K has been visiting this week, which distracted me from doing anything else then spending time with him (that's the good excuse, in my opinion).

But I have a goody for you! Mr. K was so kind to makeÂ this lovely video, how I make a whale stamp (Thank you love). It has much improved from the last one, and it has cool music. So turn on the volume and enjoy!
