Learnt yesterday:

There are two tea plants: <em>Camellia sinensis</em> from the Theaceae family. This is the Chinese Tea. <em>Chamelia sinensis</em> is smaller and grows at higher elevation. The other plant is called <em>Camellia assamica</em>. It has larger leaves, grows at lower elevations and is native in the Assam region.
