We have moved to the southern end of the Olympic Peninsula to a town called Hoquiam. On the way we passed the beautiful Lake Quinault. Only people from the Quinault Tribe are allowed to fish, because they are concerned about pollution and a decline in salmon population.

Today we went to Westport, a fisher village 20 miles from Hoquiam. I'm already talking in miles! I got fish and chips and we had the most decent cappuccino since we left Vancouver.
