2019 was difficult, emotional, and exiting, but definitely not my finest year.
<ul>
 	<li>As always I started the year with holidays on the Canary Islands.</li>
 	<li>I made a pair of wooden skis by hand, which I am very proud of. But I also hurt my knee the first week I used them...</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>I travelled much less this year, and was very happy to spend all summer in Norway. Actually, I travelled to Senja, Tucson and China.</li>
 	<li>I walked on the edge of Grand Canyon.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
 	<li>I started with bookbinding and make note books from old books.</li>
 	<li>I published a <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13331">handbook</a> with 115 authors. I've been working on this paper and book for 3 years. I also wrote a <a href="https://methodsblog.com/2019/12/09/climate-change-methods-en/">blogpost</a> about it.</li>
 	<li>I started my own project, the <a href="https://audhalbritter.com/video-on-three-d-transplant/">Three-D project</a>. I set up my first and own experiment in Norway and in China.</li>
 	<li>For the third time, I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/365xawesome/?hl=de">posted a picture every day</a>Â and will continue to do so.</li>
 	<li>I did not get funding from NFR this year.</li>
 	<li>I baked a bread on the fire.</li>
 	<li>I did not move back to Switzerland but stayed a little bit longer in Bergen. And this is fine for now, it is fine for a little bit longer.</li>
</ul>

I am still working on (re)discovering the purpose of life, staying wild, focus on what I want to give and not what I want to take and understand that nobody owes me anything (some of this is borrowed by Dr. Jacquelyn Gill).

And I want to blog a little bit more next year.

I'm glad to live in the Twenties!
