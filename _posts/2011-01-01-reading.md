What I have been reading lately:

- <em>Sechsel채uten</em>, Michael Theurillat, 2009, Ullstein Buchverlag GmbH, Berlin. Crime, that takes place in Z체rich.

- <em>Der Teufel von Mailand</em>, Martin Suter, 2006, Diogenes Verlag AG, Z체rich. Novel, that takes place in the Swiss mountains.

- <em>Der norwetische Gast</em>, Anne Holt, 2008, Piper Verlag GmbH, M체nchen. Crime that takes place in the Norwegian mountains. Unfortunately I read it in German and not in Norwegian.
