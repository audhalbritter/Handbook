Summer in Norway is late this year. 2 weeks delayed in the lowlands and we don't know about the mountains, because there is still too much snow to say. At least one of my sites is ready and I get a mini field trip each week. Last week some planst finally decided to start flowering: among the first are <em>Viola palustris </em>(Marsh violet), <em>Anthoxanthum odoratum</em> (sweet vernal grass)<b> </b>and <em>Carex vaginata</em> (Sheated sedge).
