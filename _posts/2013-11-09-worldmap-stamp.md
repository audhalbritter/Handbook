I don't like Christmas in November. No, it should not start before December! But when you own a shop, then you have to think about Christmas before December, or you'll be to late to sell your stuff.

This year I have done that and here is the Worldmap stamp. You can make your personal cards from everywhere in the world. They don't have to be for Christmas. You can also take the stamp with you when you go on holiday in case you don't like these cheesy postcards they sell everywhere.

Stamp, and your DIY card is finished.
