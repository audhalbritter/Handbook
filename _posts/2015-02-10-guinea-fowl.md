I saw my first Guinea Fowl when I was in Zambia, visiting a friend, who did her PhD in the Kafue Flats. I fell immediately in love with them. At the radio station every person had to pick an animal as radio call name (lion to sparrow...). I picked the guinea fowls, but nobody understood...

Another story I learnt about the them is that many people steal guinea fall eggs and put it together with their own chicken. And then the guineas live happily ever after with the chicken, believing they were chicks :-)

Finally, after carving lots of stamps this weekend, the guinea fowl is in the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/221986834/stamp-guinea-fowl?ref=shop_home_active_2">shop</a>.
