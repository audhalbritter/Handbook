Today I arrived back home after a rather long journey. This time I'd decieded to take the country way. It's fun but tiring. After a last very sunny day in HÃ¥voll, bathing, burning wood at the beach and grilling toast on the fire, we went to Oslo. The world was still ok in Oslo and we had a few wonderful days. Then I said goodbye to Mr. K and left to collect some more plants. I am pretty good at spoting places to find my plants by now and I'm satisfied with the catch.

Now I'm back again and very happy too. After a month in the north it's good to be back again. Cheers!
