I've bought a time lapse camera, strictly for scientific use! Next summer, I want several cameras to do my work and record when the plants start to flower and which insects pollinate them. Of course "somebody" has to look at one million pictures in the end, but I don't worry about that now.

I'm testing my new camera at the moment, not on insects but on sunsets, cloudless nights and trying to catch the moon.

By the way, this is the first time I brought as many cameras on holidays as Mr. Lovely, the photographer!
