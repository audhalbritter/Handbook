My last post has been some time ago and the reason for that is that I had to finish my PhD. I handed it in 2 weeks ago and will have my defense in 10 days. I feel very relieved already and have time to do other things than write.

Today my little nephew visited me. He has grown a lot and is smiling as soon as you look at him.

I also created a new stamp today. Suddenly I am totally into whales. And I decided to make a new serie with whales: blue whale, orca, sperm whale, grey whale and maybe a narwhale or humpback whale. The blue whale is ready.
