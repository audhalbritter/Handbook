<a href="http://visitfaroeislands.com/sheepview360/">Sheepview360</a> is a project to bring the Faroe Island on Google Street View. Durita who initiated the project has mounted cameras on sheep that walked around and take pictures from all over the islands.

Now google has reacted and has send cameras to take pictures all over the Faroe Islands. But the approach is different from other places. The pictures are taken from the back of horses, from kayak and even a wheelbarrow.
