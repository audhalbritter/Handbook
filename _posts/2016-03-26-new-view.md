The circus wagon has been moved to a new place and we have a beautiful view, pastures and cows! Everything inside has been removed and Mr. K has started to put isolation on the wall. We picked up wood and a plastic foil to prevent the wagon to get moist.

And these days we have started moving out of the flat. We will be houseless in a couple of days. But we have a lot of people who have offered us a bed and there is also Sophia, the VW bus.
