Yesterday, we drove to the centre of the island and were surprised by wineyards and grapes. The climate is not ideal but with a couple of tricks they make delicous wines. They use a layer of lava gravel to prevent evaporation and build walls to protect the grapes from strong winds. And all tasks are carried out by hand.

We visited the <a href="http://www.elgrifo.com/en/">Bodegas el Grifo</a>, which has become our favourite wine. In the backyard they have a lovely cactus garden.
