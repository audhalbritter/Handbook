Field work at the moment is very much fun. I have to collect leaves from different elevations in the Alps. So I am driving around in the Alps up and down and collecting leaves. I have a lot of helpers that drive and collect and entertain. Last week I was on the Flüälapass and had lunch at a picturesque lake in Davos Laret.
