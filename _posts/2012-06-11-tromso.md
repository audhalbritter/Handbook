I am in Tromsø (Paris of the North) now. I worked in the field the whole day, planting and measuring. It was a very nice day as it was completely windless. But compared to Trondheim it is very cold. The city is surrounded by mountains still covered in snow which cools down the air.

Yesterday I visited <a href="http://www.twointheblue.com/">Leonie and Pat</a> on their ship. We had dinner together. In a few days they will start their trip around the world on a yacht. I am very impressed of their future adventures and wish them luck!
