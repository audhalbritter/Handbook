It's where I find to myself, take the time to work with my body and leave my mind behind.

Today, after a long yoga break I had this moment. At the beginning of the lesson, I closed my eyes and was completely inside myself. Yes, yes it sounds strange, and it was. I felt the time suddenly stopped running and I got calm, something I had not felt in a long time.

A not to the future myself, please go to yoga regularly!
