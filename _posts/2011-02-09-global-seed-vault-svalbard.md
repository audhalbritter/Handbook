To ensure that in there is still enough food for future generations (genetic diversity of the world's food crops) a <a href="http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/lmd/campain/svalbard-global-seed-vault.html?id=462220">vault</a> was built on Svalbard to store the seeds of many plants. In case of climate change, war or lack of resources and thus the loss of seeds, the seed collection from Svalbard can be used. So far they have gattered more than 50'000 seeds. The building has received several prices and should survive plane crash, sea level rising and nuclear war.
