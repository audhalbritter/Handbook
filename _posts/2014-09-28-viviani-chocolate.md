This is going to be a sweet post! During my field work this summer a found a little shop on a farm in Aurland, which sold <a href="http://www.vivani-schokolade.de/">Viviani Chocolate</a>. The chocolate is produced in Germany from biologically produced cacao.Â By paying more for better quality products, they also support the local farmers.

I have only tried one type: organic dark almonds and I definitely want more!
