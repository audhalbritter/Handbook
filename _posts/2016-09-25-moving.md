This week I have moved twice. I have moved house and live now in the city centre. But I have also moved one floor up in the office (upgrade!). The view is still distracting me from working... but I hope this will go over soon.

My new home is an old wooden house 5 minutes walk from the city centre of Bergen. I have never lived so close to the centre and I like it so far. I felt it's time to get a place for myself and I enjoy my peace very much. It's an old house and I hear what's going on upstairs. The kids like to sing, which is nice, but their taste of music is less.

Mari, I just wanted to say thank you for wonderful the time at Landås with you. It has been awesome and your welcome at (almost) any time here.
