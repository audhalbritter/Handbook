I am back in the office and have to plan what I am going to do for the next 9 month before I can go out to the field again. I like organizing, but I sometimes get lost in big tasks. I have tried several things to get more organized, like writing lists. But nothing really worked until I came across the <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">Bullet Journal</a>. It looks complicated in the beginning and you have to write with a real pen, but when do you ever write these days? For me it's an easy way to organize myÂ tasks and it involves checking boxes when a task is done (which I love). In addition, I can continue to use "my bible" (a simple black Moleskin journal that I have used during my PhD, it's the second book, so I guess Bible II).
