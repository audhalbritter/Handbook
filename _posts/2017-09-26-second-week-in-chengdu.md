I like to explore new places and to figure out how things work in different parts of the world. But it can also be tiring. Even more I enjoy to come back to a place where I already know how things run.

I have been to Chengdu three times. And I start to get used to this lively Chinese life. I get used to the traffic and chaotic driving and how to safely cross a street. I learn how to communicate without understanding a single word (on both sides). I can accept that there are always people around me. But in the middle of all this noise, I have found quiet spots. A student took me to the Wenshu Monastery where we had lunch and enjoyed a tea ceremony. And I learn to write Chinese characters. I could have stayed there forever writing a language I will never be able to fully understand.

I have a bit more than a week before I will travel to Beijing for a couple of days, in the middle of the Chinese holiday. A new adventure, a new place to explore and find out how things work.
