A while ago one of my best friends decided to move into a palace. It's a beautiful old stone brick house in the middle of the city. Last time I saw it, it was still empty, because she had just moved in. But not this time!

She has a room only for her plants. The walls of the dining room are painted cornflower blue. And she has a sofa from Ikea's grandmother collection. But the toilet was the most awesome I have ever seen.
