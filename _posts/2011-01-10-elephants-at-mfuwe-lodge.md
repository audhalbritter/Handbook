A year ago I spent 2 month in Zambia. This was an extraordinary experience for me and I will never forget it. I spent three days in Mfuwe national park at the <a href="http://www.mfuwelodge.com/">Mfuwe Lodge</a>. Beside all the animals we saw there was a strange morning ritual. At 6 am in the morning some elephants would walk right through the lobby of the lodge. I never saw them, because I did not get out of bed so early. But people showed us their pictures.
