I am back in Tromsø looking after the plants. I was surprised how much weed has grown. But also the plants have grown, the snow on the mountains has melted and the gras hat grown (compare to <a href="http://aud.li/2012/06/13/tromso-2/">Tromsø in June</a>). The weather has been great. Today I even wore a t-shirt.

I have finally learnt to sleep in bright sunlight. Maybe because I am still very tired. But the plants do not sleep at all. The photosynthesize 24 hours!
