I have a shelf! Saturday started with shopping at the timber supplier and then picking a colour. It was clear from the beginning that it had to be orange, but we went for a bright orange.

Then planks were cut, sanded and painted. And we ended up spending Saturday night painting, making pizza, waxing skiis, playing guitar and singing. Tonight, the planks that had been painted twice on both sides were dry and could finally be put on the wall. Thanks for helping make such an awesome shelf!
