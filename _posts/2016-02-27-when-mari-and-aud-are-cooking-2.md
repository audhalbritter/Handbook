Tonight we cooked Chinese food and followed the reciepe from <a href="http://www.chinasichuanfood.com">chinasichuanfood</a>. These are very clear and easy guidlines for a successful Chinese meal. And our meal was completely vegan.

As soon as we fried the spicies the memories from my trip to China came back. Dear China I will come back soon!
