Today is our last day in Tromsø. The sun was shining from time to time, but it's grey and windy. We decided to visit the <a href="http://www2.uit.no/ikbViewer/page/ansatte/organisasjon/artikkel?p_document_id=71426&amp;p_dimension_id=88178&amp;p_lang=2">botanical garden</a>. And this made my day! A month ago I went on a Excursion to England and the highlight should have been a flower called Fritillaria. Sadly we only saw the white version and not the coloured one. But today in the botanical garden I found it! Tromsø seems the place to go.
