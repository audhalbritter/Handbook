I  did not want to show you this movie of how I make stamps. It's my first movie and it's not perfect! It's difficult to work below a camera, without your head poping into the picture :-) and at the end you can't see the whole stamp :-( But besides that the movie is pretty cool and I attached a picture of what you should see in the end. Enjoy!
