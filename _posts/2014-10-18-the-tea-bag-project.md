Last week I heard a talk from Judith Sarneel, biologist using tea bags for science. Yes, it sounds funny, but it's for real. The idea is to burry tea bags into the soil to measure how fast the tea decompose ("eaten by soil organisms"). The longterm goal is to get as many people involved as possible to participate to measure the decomposition rate all over the world. They use a very simple standardized method that anybody can do: burry some tea bags for 3 month, take them out, dry them and weight them.

So if your interested check out the webpage: <a href="http://www.decolab.org/tbi/">TBI </a>
