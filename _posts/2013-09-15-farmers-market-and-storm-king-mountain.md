Today there was a cute little market in Port Angeles. All local people selling their fruits and vegetables. We also had a delicious coffee and bought chantarelles for dinner. Then we drove west towards Lake Crescent and jumped right up on Storm King Mountain. Pretty steep trail but totally worth the effort!
