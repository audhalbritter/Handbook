The last supercraft kit arrived a while ago, but I only had a look at it today. This time its about felt and wool to do cool stuff for the kitchen. In addition, there is a little booklet for your seasonal recipes!

I am not sure yet what to create, but I wonder if I can use this piece of felt to make a mountain pillow that I have wanted to do for a long time!
