After a long period with cold weather and much rain the sun has found Bergen again. A few hours with sun and all the miserable weather is forgotten. People smile, go outside and enjoy.

I used the few sunny hours to climb another of Bergens mountains: Løvstakken. With 477 m Løvstakken is not the highest mountain but still very popular for hiking.
