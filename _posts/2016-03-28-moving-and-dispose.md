The last couple of month we have tried to reduce our belongings. The reason is Mr. K is moving to a circus wagon and I live in Norway. We have tried to sell and give away most of it, but finally we had to throw away things, that are damaged or have no value. It's astonishing how much things we collect.

Now the flat is empty and we my skateboard carrier can start!
