This <a href="http://www.dennyenordiskeflora.dk/default.htm">book</a> saved me this summer during my field survey. It's not only a very helpful field guide with all important plant species from Scandinavia but it's also a book with lovely drawings. When I look at the book I wish I was a painter making drawings for floras.
