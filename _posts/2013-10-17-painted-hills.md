This post wasn't supposed to take so long! But I am not going to blame anyone or make bad excuses. Let's just say life is not always fair... but here it is:

I had been locking forward to this moment for some time. And the sight of the first painted mountains was amazing. They are very unique. Unfortunately, shortly after we arrived, a park ranger came and said that the park is closed and we could not be there. But we realized that he does not really like to tell people to leave. He let us wander around in the park for a while because we had come such a long way. Thank you!

The different color layers are volcanic ash that has oxidated with time.
