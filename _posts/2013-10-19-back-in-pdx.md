We are back in Portland and are spending our last days of this trip in the sun. We rented some bikes yesterday to see parts of the city we haven't before. And we found a great place along Alberta Street. Small shops, art galleries and great food. In the evening we went to a whisky bar (<a href="http://www.mwlpdx.com/">Multnomah Whiskey Library</a>). This was very much fun because the bartender was very patient suggesting us drinks we would like.

Tomorrow we are heading back home.Â See you all very soon!
