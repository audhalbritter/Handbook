We have made it to the USA. A bit scared how the US custom would treat us, we queued up to take the ferry to Port Angeles. But everything was very easy. The scanner for our passports did not work and we were lucky to be able to stay in the air-conditioned room for a while. Everybody was very nice and we were allowed to enter the US.

Port Angeles is a small city but right at the edge of the Olympic National Park. We intend to stay here for a while. The park is huge and offers many scenic hikes. Today we walked for hours, saw birds and chipmunks, but just when we came back to the car park there were two blacktail deers.

PS: by the way the monkey eye problem is solved and his name is Gromit.
